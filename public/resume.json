          "During my time in the full-time web development immersive program, I learned the fundamentals of web and software development. I had the opportunity to create many production-ready applications, both on the front-end and back-end, that were similar to what I would work on in a real work environment. I also learned to hone my technical soft skills with the help of the experienced instructors and peers. Futhermore, I was working alongside many startups and Fortune 500 companies while finishing my capstone project, and had many networking opportunities as part of my daily life at Galvanize."
